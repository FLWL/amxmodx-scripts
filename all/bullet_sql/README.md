## Bullet SQL

This is an account/stats manager that allows other plugins to easily save their users' stats without worrying about things like identificating users. The accounts and stats are saved into a SQL database and are meant to be integrated with the SMF forum software. This plugin is also integrated with AMXBans, as new users can get VIP rights as a reward for registering.
