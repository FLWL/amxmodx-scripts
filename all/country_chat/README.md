## Country Chat

The ultimate yet simple chat mod for Counter-Strike servers. Displays player's country code in front of their name when they type something. Also chat will be decorated in a different way for different admin levels. For example, a standard admin with just ADMIN_CHAT access will have their text displayed as green. People with ADMIN_LEVEL_G have thei country code's brackets colored green. Players with ADMIN_CVAR access, such as server owners, have their whole country code displayed in green.

This chat plugin also features IP and swear word detection both in chat and player names, anti-flood, double spaces remover, bad chars remover, chat logger, leetspeak filter, command hider (disabled by default).

Also this plugin differs from others in the sense that if a player writes an infringing message, they still see that their message went through, but others cannot see it, essentially a "shadow ban".
