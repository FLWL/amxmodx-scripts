## Racemod

A work-in-progress mod which is built around the idea that players could use the wacky HL engine vehicles to have a race between each other. It would require special maps with vehicles built in.

This plugin has a countdown at the start of the round during which players must find themselves a vehicle to drive and jump in. After the countdown reaches zero, the race starts, and anyone who leaves their vehicle or didn't find one will be eliminated.

The idea is that map makers could make a track and put in special triggers for the finish zone for the plugin to register. The plugin could offer upgrades to the vehicles, such as better tires or increased engine power. In the source code there are efforts to replicate the HL engine vehicle mechanics in AMXX code, however, some bugs still exist.
