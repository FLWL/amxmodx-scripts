## Entity Remover

This plugin removes some annoying entities that disrupt the normal operation of a deathmatch mod. Such entities include the "player_weaponstrip" for example, which removes all weapons from the player, sometimes causing the player to spawn with no weapons whatsoever in a CSDM server.
