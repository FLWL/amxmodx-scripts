## KVIP 2

A VIP plugin for regular 1.6 servers. VIPs are players with the access flag "t". They have an oppurtunity to get a free primary rifle and a secondary pistol every round, with AWP being in the choice every 3rd round. In addition, they can see the damage they do real time, plus get a small amount of health back after a kill and are rewarded with a bit of extra money.

By putting a "noweapons.ini" file with a list of maps that VIP weapons should be disabled on into the amxmodx configs folder, the plugin does not give VIPs weapons on these maps.
