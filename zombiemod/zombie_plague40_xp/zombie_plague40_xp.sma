	-*- Description -*-
	-------------------
	
	Zombie Plague is a Counter-Strike server side modification, developed as
	an AMX Mod X plugin, which completely revamps the gameplay, turning the
	game into an intense "Humans vs Zombies" survival experience.
	
	Even though it's strongly based on the classic zombie infection mods, it
	takes the concept to a new level by introducing:
	
	* New Gameplay Modes: Nemesis, Survivor, Multi Infection, Swarm, Plague
	* Zombie Classes System: allows addding unlimited custom zombie classes
	* Ammo Packs: awarded to skilled players, can be exchanged for goods
	* Extra Items System: allows adding unlimited custom items to buy
	* Custom Grenades: Napalms, Frost Nades, Flares, and Infection Bombs
	* Deathmatch Mode: where zombies or humans can continually respawn
	* Admin Menus: to easily perform the included console commands
	* Special Effects: from the HL Engine, such as dynamic lighting and fog
	
	There is plenty of customization as well, which enables you to create
	several different styles of gameplay. You can:
	
	* Set zombies and humans' health, speed, models, rewards, and more
	* Toggle unlimited ammo and adjustable knockback for weapons
	* Separately enable and customize the new gameplay modes to your liking
	* Change overall map lighting (lightnings available for the dark settings)
	* Set different colors and sizes for flashlight and nightvision
	* Toggle leap (long jumping) and pain shock free (no damage slowdowns)
	* Toggle various infection effects, such as sparks and screen shakes
	* Enable random spawning (CSDM-spawn friendly)
	* Replace sounds or add some background themes
	* And many more...

	-*- Requirements -*-
	--------------------
	
	* Mods: Counter-Strike 1.6 or Condition-Zero
	* AMXX: Version 1.8.0 or later
	
	--------------------
	-*- Installation -*-
	--------------------
	
	Extract the contents from the .zip file to your server's mod directory
	("cstrike" or "czero"). Make sure to keep folder structure.
	
	-----------------------
	-*- Official Forums -*-
	-----------------------
	
	For the official Zombie Plague forums visit:
	http://forums.alliedmods.net/forumdisplay.php?f=126
	
	There you can:
	
	* Get the latest releases and early betas
	* Discuss new features and suggestions
	* Share sub-plugins (expansions) for the mod
	* Find the support and help you need
	* Report any bugs you might find
	* And all that sort of stuff...
	
	-------------------------------
	-*- CVARS and Customization -*-
	-------------------------------
	
	For a complete and in-depth cvar list, look at the zombieplague.cfg file
	located in the amxmodx\configs directory.
	
	Additionally, you can change player models, sounds, weather effects,
	and some other stuff from the configuration file zombieplague.ini.
	
	As for editing attributes of zombie classes or custom extra items, you'll
	find a zp_zombieclasses.ini and zp_extraitems.ini. These files will be
	automatically updated as you install new custom classes or items with
	new entries for you to edit conveniently.
	
	---------------
	-*- History -*-
	---------------
	
	This project started back on late 2007, when the free infection mods
	around were quite buggy and I wanted to make one on my own. With little
	to no experience at AMXX scripting, I had to start from the very scratch.
	
	Not after spending over a week looking at many plugins (mainly Zombie
	Swarm) and scarce tutorials, I somehow managed to have all the basic
	stuff working quite well (even though the code was a real mess). The
	following months were spent polishing things up and trying to fulfill
	new original ideas, most of them quite worth the hard work.
	
	In the meantime, I got the chance to try the plugin out on a 32 man
	server. This meant a huge progress on development, and after lots of
	testing and bug fixing, the mod turned out to be more than the simple
	infection plugin I had originally planned it to be.
	
	The project has come a long way since, and I'm glad to say I'm finally
	making it freely available. All I'm asking in return is to keep my
	name in the plugin.
	
	-Enjoy!
	
	----------------------
	-*- Infection Mode -*-
	----------------------
	
	On every round players start out as humans, equip themselves with a few
	weapons and grenades, and head to the closest cover they find, knowing
	that one of them is infected with the T-Virus, and will suddenly turn
	into a vicious brain eating creature.
	
	Only little time after, the battle for survival begins. The first zombie
	has to infect as many humans as possible to cluster a numerous zombie
	horde and take over the world.
	
	Maps are set in the dark by default. Humans must use flashlights to light
	their way and spot any enemies. Zombies, on the other hand, have night
	vision but can only attack melee.
	
	--------------------------
	-*- New Gameplay Modes -*-
	--------------------------
	
	* Nemesis:
	   The first zombie may turn into a Nemesis, a powerful fast-moving
	   beast. His goal is to kill every human while sustaining the gunfire.
	
	* Survivor:
	   Everyone became a zombie except him. The survivor gets a machinegun
	   with unlimited ammo and has to stop the never-ending army of undead.
	
	* Multiple Infection:
	   The round starts with many humans infected, so the remaining players
	   will have to act quickly in order to control the situation.
	
	* Swarm Mode:
	   Half of the players turn into zombies, the rest become immune and
	   cannot be infected. It's a battle to death.
	
	* Plague Mode: [bonus]
	   A full armed Survivor and his soldiers are to face Nemesis and
	   his zombie minions. The future of the world is in their hands.
	
	--------------------
	-*- In-Game Menu -*-
	--------------------
	
	Players can access the mod menu by typing "zpmenu" on chat, or by
	pressing the M ("chooseteam") key. The menu allows players to choose
	their zombie class, buy extra items, get unstuck, or see the ingame
	help. Admins will find an additional option to easily perform all
	console commands.
	
	----------------------
	-*- Admin Commands -*-
	----------------------
	
	The following console commands are available:
	
	* zp_zombie <target> - Turn someone into a Zombie
	* zp_human <target> - Turn someone back to Human
	* zp_nemesis <target> - Turn someone into a Nemesis
	* zp_survivor <target> - Turn someone into a Survivor
	* zp_respawn <target> - Respawn someone
	* zp_swarm - Start Swarm Mode (*)
	* zp_multi - Start Multi Infection (*)
	* zp_plague - Start Plague Mode (*)
	
	(*) - These commands can only be used at round start, that is, when the
	T-Virus notice is shown on screen. 
	
	------------------
	-*- Plugin API -*-
	------------------
	
	From version 3.6, some natives and forwards have been added to ease the
	development of sub-plugins, though you may also find them useful to work
	out compatibility issues with existing plugins.
	
	Look for the zombieplague.inc file in your amxmodx\scripting\include
	folder for the full documented list.
	
	----------------------
	-*- Zombie Classes -*-
	----------------------
	
	From version 4.0 it is possible to create and add an unlimited number of
	zombie classes to the main mod. They can be made as separate plugins,
	by using the provided zombie class API, and easily distributed.
	
	By default, five zombie classes are included:
	
	* Classic Zombie: well balanced zombie for beginners.
	* Raptor Zombie: fast moving zombie, but also the weakest.
	* Poison Zombie: light weighed zombie, jumps higher.
	* Big Zombie: slow but strong zombie, with lots of hit points.
	* Leech Zombie: regains additional health when infecting.
	
	-------------------
	-*- Extra Items -*-
	-------------------
	
	From version 4.0 it is possible to add an unlimited number of items
	which can be purchased through the Extra Items menu. All you need
	to do is use the provided item registration natives on your custom
	plugins. You can set the name, the cost in ammo packs, and the team
	the extra item should be available for.
	
	By default there is a number of items already included, listed here:
	
	* Night Vision: makes you able to see in the dark for a single round [Human]
	* T-Virus Antidote: makes you turn back to your human form [Zombie]
	* Zombie Madness: you develop a powerful shield for a short time [Zombie]
	* Infection Bomb: infects anyone within its explosion radius [Zombie]
	
	You are also able to choose some weapons to act as extra items, and change
	ammo packs costs in the customization file (zombieplague.ini).
