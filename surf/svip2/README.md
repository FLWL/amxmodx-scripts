## SVIP 2

A VIP plugin for surf servers that is quite similar to the KVIP 2 meant for normal ones. VIPs can see the amount of damage they deal, heal a bit after a successful kill, choose a secondary weapon each round along with a bonus.

The bonuses include a random primary weapon, an extra HE grenade, +25 health or a "lifesaver" that will save you from falling into the jail 1 time (should work on almost every map without needing manual setup).
